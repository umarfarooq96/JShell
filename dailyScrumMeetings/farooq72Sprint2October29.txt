What did I do last time?
	- Worked on JShell
    - Worked on command validator and interpreter
	- Worked on ConsoleWriter
	- Finished history command
	

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish up PWD
	- Add some test cases and make sure the other commands are ready to be added
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Testing PWD required CD so we can change current working directory.
