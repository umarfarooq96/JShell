What did I do last time?
	- Finished my design for !number command
	- Have an idea of how to test !number
	

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish !number command 
	- Finish !number test cases
	- Start polishing any bugs/inefficient code of the assignment
	- Make proper use of exceptions.
	
Am I blocked on anything?
