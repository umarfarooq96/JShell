What did I do last time?
	- Made it possible to redirect output into a file
		- Changes to JShell, Validator, Command, DataWriter, FileWriter, ConsoleWriter
	- Thought of a new design so there are no problems with output
	

What do I plan to do now?
	- Fix up FileWriter
	- Being implementing commands
	
Am I blocked on anything?
	- FileWriter may need to use echo so we need to fix echo fist.
